5- Method Signature
your colleague wrote a function to calculate something, unfortunately he didn’t choose a good name for it, so you don’t know what it does. But from the way that he used it, can you guess how does it look like?

Ans

var (averageSalary, numberOfEmployee) = await FindAverangeCompanySalaryNetAmount(0L, 10L, 0L == 10L);
